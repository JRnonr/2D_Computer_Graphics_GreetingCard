Draw a 2D New Year greeting card using the specified freeglut library


## 1. Description
In the assessment, I draw a tree with some a star and some colorful lights, a sun, a moon, a bonfire, a snowman, two balloons, two fireworks, some clouds and a line of words. I design a picture with both day and night, and it can be switched by the mouse. The sun, fire, snowman, clouds and lights all have animation effects. The sun is rotating, the bonfire is burning, the hands of the snowman are shaking, the clouds are fluttering and the colored lights keep flashing with different colors. <br>
I also draw a picture for another way of viewing which can be switched by the keyboard and in this viewing way, the same operations also can work. <br>
I switch the day, night and the different viewing way by changing the value of RGB and the transparency, which means I only show the pictures that I want to be seen and hide other pictures.
